        <h1>Daniel Fleischman</h1>
        <p>I am a PhD student in the ORIE department with minors in CS and Applied Math.
          I started competing on ACM in 2005, when I was in college and was hooked up on competitions since then.
          I had to retire from ACM-ICPC after my second world final in 2007 (you can't compete after two WF), so I started to coach in 2009,
          still in my home university, in Brazil. I've been the coach for Cornell since 2012, and I love it!
          <br><br>
          Even being retired from ACM-ICPC I can (and do) still compete on other programming competitions like Google CodeJam,
          Facebook HackerCup and Topcoder Open. Other competitions that interest me are Mathematics competitions (like the IMC)
          and puzzle competitions (like the Microsoft Puzzle Challenge).</p>
